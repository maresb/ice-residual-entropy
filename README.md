## Description

I'm interested in exploring [ice-type models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-type_model) and their residual entropy.

Currently, I have a visualization of (the oxygen atoms of) [Ice Ih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ih), which is ordinary ice.

Both [Ice Ic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ic) and [square ice](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.162.162) have much simpler structures, and will be added soon.
